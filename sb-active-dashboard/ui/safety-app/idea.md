# Safety Page

Addresses the where, when, and why questions about safety incidents. 

Provides locations for current high risk areas
- high incident rates, where improvements are not being seen year over year
- map of hexagons increasing/decreasing 


1) When you open the page, you want to see a webmap of high risk vs low risk areas. This is for the public to know where to feel safe walking and biking around town andfor planners to dig in deeper, and get a broader sense of where to address safety needs.
- 5 year snapshot heatmap of latest incidents for peds vs bikes
- 5 year incident records for peds vs bikes

I don't think we need filters for this initial view. Just static... It would be also be cool to 



2) After getting a larger snapshot, you might want to zoom in and get more detailed stats. So you open up the safety stat by area tool. Running this tool, would open up a new panel with prompts to select a roadway user, select an aoi/hexagons, select a year, etc. This would plot the records as well as pull up summary stats



## Safety stats by area
- user selects hexagons or road polylines
    - either by clicking, drawing aoi, or selecting city/jurisdiction
- incidents are aggregated and summary stats are reported:
    - total incidents with categories broken down by severity, reporting source, cause of collision
    - yearly trends
    - time of day trends
    - day of week trends
- filters directly impact reported safety stats

## Map Visuals
